# odin-recipes
In this project I will be making a list of my favorite food's recipes using the basics that I learned in this course. I will be using everything from paragraphs to images and links.

Doing this project made me realize that making the websites structure is not that complicated as I am expecting. This is a fun project and I learned a lot :>
